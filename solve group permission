[Solved] SoftException in Application.cpp:267: File “/home/…/public_html/index.php” is writeable by group
Updated on : Dec 1, 2019 Category : cPanel/WHM
You might have come across the following error in your cPanel error log  :

SoftException in Application.cpp:267: File “/home/username/public_html/foldername/index.php” is writeable by group

The issue is due to folder and files permission not properly set and cPanel not allowing them to run on user end.

To fix this issue, simply login into server (we need SSH access to resolve this) and run the following 2 commands :


cd /home/username/public_html

Replace username by your user.


find html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

find html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
